## Problem

A projectile is launched at an angle of $45°$ with initial velocity $20 \text{ m/s}$. How long is it in the air? (Use $g = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$)

## Solution

For projectile motion, time of flight is: $T = \frac{2u \sin\theta}{g}$

Where:
- $u = 20 \text{ m/s}$
- $\theta = 45°$, so $\sin 45° = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$
- $g = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$

$$T = \frac{2(20) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{10} = \frac{40}{10\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.83 \text{ s}$$
