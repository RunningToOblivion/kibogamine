## Problem

A block of mass $m = 5 \text{ kg}$ is placed on an inclined plane at angle $\theta = 30°$ to the horizontal. The block is in equilibrium.

Calculate:
1. The normal force $N$ acting on the block
2. The static friction force $f_s$ required to keep the block in equilibrium

Use $g = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$.

## Solution

**Step 1: Identify the forces**

The block experiences:
- Weight: $W = mg$ (acting vertically downward)
- Normal force: $N$ (perpendicular to the inclined surface)
- Static friction: $f_s$ (parallel to the inclined surface, opposing motion)

**Step 2: Resolve weight into components**

- Perpendicular to plane: $W_\perp = mg\cos\theta$
- Parallel to plane (down): $W_\parallel = mg\sin\theta$

**Step 3: Calculate normal force**

For equilibrium perpendicular to the plane:
$$N = mg\cos\theta$$

$$N = 5 \times 10 \times \cos(30°)$$

$$N = 50 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 25\sqrt{3} \approx 43.3 \text{ N}$$

**Step 4: Calculate static friction force**

For equilibrium parallel to the plane:
$$f_s = mg\sin\theta$$

$$f_s = 5 \times 10 \times \sin(30°)$$

$$f_s = 50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25 \text{ N}$$

**Answer:** Normal force $N \approx 43.3 \text{ N}$, Static friction force $f_s = 25 \text{ N}$
