## Problem

What is the molarity of a solution containing 5 moles of NaCl dissolved in 2 liters of water?

## Solution

Molarity is defined as: $M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$

$$M = \frac{5 \text{ mol}}{2 \text{ L}} = 2.5 \text{ M}$$

The solution has a molarity of 2.5 M.
