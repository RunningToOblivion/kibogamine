## Problem

A car accelerates uniformly from rest at $a = 2 \text{ m/s}^2$. What is its velocity after traveling 50 m?

## Solution

Using the kinematic equation: $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$

Where:
- $u = 0$ (starts from rest)
- $a = 2 \text{ m/s}^2$
- $s = 50 \text{ m}$

$$v^2 = 0 + 2(2)(50) = 200$$

$$v = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 \text{ m/s}$$
